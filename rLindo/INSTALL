# rLindo - The R interface to LINDO API

## Requirements

1. LINDO API x.y [(https://www.lindo.com)](https://www.lindo.com/index.php/ls-downloads/try-lindo-api), where x.y is the version tag, e.g. 16.0

2. R software 3.5 or later [(https://cran.r-project.org/index.html)](https://cran.r-project.org/index.html).

3. Rtools (Windows only) [(http://www.cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#The-Windows-toolset)](http://www.cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-admin.html#The-Windows-toolset).


## Installation for Windows

**NOTE**: Make sure to run the command window as administrator to perform these steps.

1. Make sure environment variable LINDOAPI_HOME points to the installation path of LINDO API. 

        C:> set LINDOAPI_HOME="c:\lindoapi"

2. Navigate to the directory `c:\lindoapi\R`, where the file `rLindo_x.y.tar.gz` is located.

3. Run the following batch script to install the rLindo package, where `<nn>` stands for the rtools version.

        C:> install-rlindo-r<nn>.bat

4. Test whether rLindo package has been installed successfully by using the following command in R.

        > library(rLindo)


## Installation for Linux and Mac/OSX

**NOTE**: Make sure to login as the 'root' user or use 'sudo' to perform these steps.

1. Set environment variable LINDOAPI_HOME to the installation path of LINDO API. e.g. 
  
        $ export LINDOAPI_HOME=/opt/lindoapi

   To have this variable set automatically, add the above line to your `~/.bashrc` file.

2. Navigate to the directory `/opt/lindoapi/R`, where the file `rLindo_x.y.tar.gz` is located.

3. Run the following batch script to install the rLindo package.
 
        $ ./install-rlindo.sh

    For Mac/OSX users, if you get an error message like below: 

        checking for gcc... llvm-gcc-4.2 -arch x86_64 -std=gnu99
        checking whether the c compiler works...no

    link llvm-gcc-4.2 to your gcc compiler using command:

        $ sudo ln -fs llvm-gcc llvm-gcc-4.2

4. For Mac/OSX users, change the install name of `rLindo.so` using command:

        $ install_name_tool -change @loader_path/liblindo64.x.y.dylib \
                             ${LINDOAPI_HOME}/bin/osx64x86/liblindo64.x.y.dylib \
                             ${R_HOME}/library/rLindo/libs/rLindo.so

    **Note**: The above command assumes the system is 64-bit and R_HOME environment variable is 
    defined. Otherwise, please revise the command accordingly.

5. Test whether rLindo package has been installed successfully by using the following command in R.

        > library(rLindo)
